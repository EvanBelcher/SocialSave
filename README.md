# SocialSave - Yes, And
###Friends help friends save money.

##About
Saving money is generally thought of as a boring and labored task. SocialSave revolutionizes this in a way that both more enjoyable and more effective than traditional methods.

SocialSave allows users to designate their income and a saving goal for the week. They are shown data about whether they are on pace to meet their goal. At the end of the week, points are given to the user based on how their actual spending compared to the goal they set.

**This is where it gets interesting.** Every user is encouraged to be in a Group with multiple friends. This group accrues points based on the scores of each member. These points accumulate from week to week and recieve a bonus multiplier on weeks where all members save according to their goals. The group points can be redeemed to **real-world rewards:** either a gift card, or a donation to charity of twice the value.

We believe that the social aspect of SocialSave will inspire positive peer pressure among members of a group and encourage saving in a way that will reap better rewards and leave a better taste in everyone's mouth.
